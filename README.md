# Survey Goose

## Overview

This is a survey-application being developed as a personal project. Currently I have developed the frontend features of this application and will implement backend functionality in a future iteration.

Features of this application:

- Create-React-App
- React features:
  - Redux
  - Router v6
  - React-Transition-Group
- 3D Model on Homescreen created using Blender, configured using ThreeFiber & Drei

Please note that this website is currently a work in progress and is still being developed.

## Using the App

Click on individual product items to navigate to the product detail landing page. Select an available quantity, and add to cart. Navigate to the cart using the header navigation, where you can adjust individual product quantity or remove items from cart. Local Storage keeps cart items saved in browser. User-Authentication on front- and backend allows a user to proceed to enter order details and shipping information. Dummy PayPal API used to mimic payment authorization.

## Dependencies

For a list of dependencies please refer to the package.JSON file.
